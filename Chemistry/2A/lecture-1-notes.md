# Chem 2A Lecture 1 Notes 1/10/2023

* Covered in the course
  * Atoms + Elements
  * Molecules + Compounds
  * Reactions + Reaction Stoichiometry
  * Chemical Equilibrium
  * Gases
  * Acids, bases, pH
* Calculation best practices
  * Significant Figures
    * For multiplication and division your answer should be reported to the min
    of the num of significant figures in the inputs
    * Addition and subtraction
      * Rounded to the least number of deciaml places used in the calculation
      * Note that 1000. is different than 1000 in terms of significant figures.
      The former has four significant figures (since the trailing zeros) are
      significant as indicated by the decimal point. The latter only has one
      significant figure. Assume all trailing zeros are not significant.
      * Multiply by exact numbers/conversions that are known to many decimal
      places doesn't impact the number of significant figures.
      * Go all the way through a calculation then check significant figures.
      When going back through a calculation to check significant figures,
      it seems like you pretty much perform all the operations and but only
      noting how many significant figures are spit out at the end of each
      calculation rather than actually performing the computations again.
      * Examples of significant figures and scientific notation
        * 100 -> 1 * 10^2 - one significant figure
        * 1.0 * 10^2 - two significant figures, can't really be represented in
        the standard form
        * 100. -> 1.00 * 10^2 -> three significant figures
  * Why are units important?
    * To classify what you're measuring
    * To help with precision
    * Provides standardization
    * Examples
      * mass(g)
      * volume(L)
      * distance(m)
      * temperature(K/C)
      * time(s)
  * Scientific Calculatons
    * Read problems carefully
    * Highlight all terms and data
    * Note relationships
    * Use dimensional analysis
    * Always use units
    * Pay attention to conversion factors and ensure they are correct.
    * Double check algebra
