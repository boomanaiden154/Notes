# Prelecture 2 Notes 1/11/2023

* Notes from prelecture videos
  * We know that an atom is made up of the following based on our current models:
    * electrons - negative charge $e^-$. Have an extremely small mass. Charge
    of -1 and have about five orders of magnitude less mass than a proton
    or neutron.
    * Protons - Positive charge. Notation: $p^+$ sometimes as an abbreviation.
    * Neutrons - neutral/zero charge. Notation: $n^0$.
  * Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus of the atom.
  * Electrons are out in the electron cloud.
  * Notation for elements/isotopes:
    * Element symbol (a letter or pair of letters. Unique for ach atom)
    * Atomic number is in the lower left hand corner. Corresponds to the number
    of protons are within the atom's nucleus.
    * Mass number is in the upper left hand corner. It's the number of particles
    in the nucleus, so the number of neutrons in addition to the number of
    protons.
    * $^{A}_{Z}X$
      * $A$ is the mass, $Z$ is the atomic number, and $X$ is the symbol for the
      element.
    * Charge goes in the upper right corner if the species is not neutral.
    * Atomic number and the element symbol are somewhat redundant because they
    represent the same info.
  * Masses for subatomic particles will be included on the equation sheet.
* Textbook section 2.6 - The Modern View of Atomic Structure
  * The nucleus is presumed to have protons (positively charged particles with
  charge equal in magnitude to that of the electron), and neutrons (no charge,
  similar mass to protons).
  * The nucleus is incredibly small compared to the overall size of the atom,
  but accounts for virtually all of its mass.
  * Atoms have different properties due to their electron configuration which
  is a product of how many electrons they have. Consequence of having a
  different number of protons due to atoms in non-ionic states having neutral
  charge.
* Textbook section 2.7 - Molecules and Ions
  * Chemical bonds are what hold atoms together. Atoms can form bonds by
  sharing electrons (covalent bonds). The collection of atoms grouped together
  by a covalent bond is called a molecule.
  * Chemical formula can used to describe molecules.
  * The structural formula gives a lot more information about a molecule
  which shows the actual shape of the molecule.
  * Structural formula can be drawn in varying levels of detail (ie just showing
  what atoms are connected to what or even showing how they are placed
  relative to each other).
  * Space filling models and ball and stick models are alternative ways of
  looking at molecules as a whole.
  * An ion is an atom/molecule that has a positive/negative charge.
  * Classical example is table salt(well, just the salt part)/sodium chloride.
  Transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine makes both of the atoms
  ionic and the opposite charges attract each other.
  * A solid of almost purely ions is an ionic solid, usually called a salt.
  * There can also be polyatmoic ions which are ions where an entire group
  of atoms/molecule has a net charge.
* Textbook section 2.8 - An introduction to the periodic table
  * The periodic table shows all known elements (well, usually if it's actually
  up to date) and provides some information about each of them.
  * Most of the elements are metals which are characterized by specific
  properties, particularly conductivity (both electrical and thermal), and
  their ability to by physically formed.
  * The nonmetals appear in the upper right hand corner of the table and on
  the very upper left hand side (hydrogen).
  * The periodic table has been created so that columns (groups/families) have
  similar properties. A consequence of proton numbering/electron configuration.
  * Eg alkali metals are very active (column 1), alkaline earth metals all form
  ions with a +2 charge, halogens (Group 7A) all form diatomic molecules, the
  last column of noble gases
  * Horizontal rows on the able are called periods.
* Textbook section 2.9 - Naming Simple Compounds
  * There are many common names for compounds, and most of these come from
  before chemistry was standardized.
  * In Chemistry there is a system for naming compounds.
  * Ionic binary compounds (type I)
    * The cation is named first, the anion second
    * A one atom cation takes its name from the element. Eg $Na^+$ is just
    called sodium.
    * A one atom anion is named from the first part of its element name
    and adding the word ide. Eg a chlorine anion is called chloride.
    * List of common monotamic cations
      * $H^+$ - Hydrogen
      * $Li^+$ - Lithium
      * $Na^+$ - Sodium
      * $K^+$ - Potassium
      * $Cs^+$ - Cesium
      * $Be^{2+}$ - Beryllium
      * $Mg^{2+}$ - Magnesium
      * $Ca^{2+}$ - Calcium
      * $Ba^{2+}$ - Barium
      * $Al^{3+}$ - Aluminum
      * $Ag^+$ - Silver
      * $Zn^{2+}$ - Zinc
    * List of common monoatomic anions:
      * $H^-$ - Hydride
      * $F^-$ - Fluoride
      * $Cl^-$ - Chloride
      * $Br^-$ - Bromide
      * $I^-$ - Iodide
      * $O^{2-}$ - Oxide
      * $S^{2-}$ - Sulfide
      * $N^{3-}$ - Nitride
      * $p^{3-}$ - Phosphide
