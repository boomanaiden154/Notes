# Prelecture 2 Notes 1/11/2023

* We know that an atom is made up of the following based on our current models:
  * electrons - negative charge $e^-$. Have an extremely small mass. Charge
  of -1 and have about five orders of magnitude less mass than a proton
  or neutron.
  * Protons - Positive charge. Notation: $p^+$ sometimes as an abbreviation.
  * Neutrons - neutral/zero charge. Notation: $n^0$.
* Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus of the atom.
* Electrons are out in the electron cloud.
* Notation for elements/isotopes:
  * Element symbol (a letter or pair of letters. Unique for ach atom)
  * Atomic number is in the lower left hand corner. Corresponds to the number
  of protons are within the atom's nucleus.
  * Mass number is in the upper left hand corner. It's the number of particles
  in the nucleus, so the number of neutrons in addition to the number of
  protons.
  * $^{A}_{Z}X$
    * $A$ is the mass, $Z$ is the atomic number, and $X$ is the symbol for the
    element.
  * Charge goes in the upper right corner if the species is not neutral.
  * Atomic number and the element symbol are somewhat redundant because they
  represent the same info.
* Masses for subatomic particles will be included on the equation sheet.
