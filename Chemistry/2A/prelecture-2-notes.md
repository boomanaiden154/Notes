# Prelecture 2 Notes 1/11/2023

* Notes from prelecture videos
  * We know that an atom is made up of the following based on our current models:
    * electrons - negative charge $e^-$. Have an extremely small mass. Charge
    of -1 and have about five orders of magnitude less mass than a proton
    or neutron.
    * Protons - Positive charge. Notation: $p^+$ sometimes as an abbreviation.
    * Neutrons - neutral/zero charge. Notation: $n^0$.
  * Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus of the atom.
  * Electrons are out in the electron cloud.
  * Notation for elements/isotopes:
    * Element symbol (a letter or pair of letters. Unique for ach atom)
    * Atomic number is in the lower left hand corner. Corresponds to the number
    of protons are within the atom's nucleus.
    * Mass number is in the upper left hand corner. It's the number of particles
    in the nucleus, so the number of neutrons in addition to the number of
    protons.
    * $^{A}_{Z}X$
      * $A$ is the mass, $Z$ is the atomic number, and $X$ is the symbol for the
      element.
    * Charge goes in the upper right corner if the species is not neutral.
    * Atomic number and the element symbol are somewhat redundant because they
    represent the same info.
  * Masses for subatomic particles will be included on the equation sheet.
* Textbook section 2.6 - The Modern View of Atomic Structure
  * The nucleus is presumed to have protons (positively charged particles with
  charge equal in magnitude to that of the electron), and neutrons (no charge,
  similar mass to protons).
  * The nucleus is incredibly small compared to the overall size of the atom,
  but accounts for virtually all of its mass.
  * Atoms have different properties due to their electron configuration which
  is a product of how many electrons they have. Consequence of having a
  different number of protons due to atoms in non-ionic states having neutral
  charge.
* Textbook section 2.7 - Molecules and Ions
  * Chemical bonds are what hold atoms together. Atoms can form bonds by
  sharing electrons (covalent bonds). The collection of atoms grouped together
  by a covalent bond is called a molecule.
  * Chemical formula can used to describe molecules.
  * The structural formula gives a lot more information about a molecule
  which shows the actual shape of the molecule.
  * Structural formula can be drawn in varying levels of detail (ie just showing
  what atoms are connected to what or even showing how they are placed
  relative to each other).
  * Space filling models and ball and stick models are alternative ways of
  looking at molecules as a whole.
  * An ion is an atom/molecule that has a positive/negative charge.
  * Classical example is table salt(well, just the salt part)/sodium chloride.
  Transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine makes both of the atoms
  ionic and the opposite charges attract each other.
  * A solid of almost purely ions is an ionic solid, usually called a salt.
  * There can also be polyatmoic ions which are ions where an entire group
  of atoms/molecule has a net charge.
* Textbook section 2.8 - An introduction to the periodic table
  * The periodic table shows all known elements (well, usually if it's actually
  up to date) and provides some information about each of them.
  * Most of the elements are metals which are characterized by specific
  properties, particularly conductivity (both electrical and thermal), and
  their ability to by physically formed.
  * The nonmetals appear in the upper right hand corner of the table and on
  the very upper left hand side (hydrogen).
  * The periodic table has been created so that columns (groups/families) have
  similar properties. A consequence of proton numbering/electron configuration.
  * Eg alkali metals are very active (column 1), alkaline earth metals all form
  ions with a +2 charge, halogens (Group 7A) all form diatomic molecules, the
  last column of noble gases
  * Horizontal rows on the able are called periods.
* Textbook section 2.9 - Naming Simple Compounds
  * There are many common names for compounds, and most of these come from
  before chemistry was standardized.
  * In Chemistry there is a system for naming compounds.
  * Ionic binary compounds (type I)
    * The cation is named first, the anion second
    * A one atom cation takes its name from the element. Eg $Na^+$ is just
    called sodium.
    * A one atom anion is named from the first part of its element name
    and adding the word ide. Eg a chlorine anion is called chloride.
    * List of common monotamic cations
      * $H^+$ - Hydrogen
      * $Li^+$ - Lithium
      * $Na^+$ - Sodium
      * $K^+$ - Potassium
      * $Cs^+$ - Cesium
      * $Be^{2+}$ - Beryllium
      * $Mg^{2+}$ - Magnesium
      * $Ca^{2+}$ - Calcium
      * $Ba^{2+}$ - Barium
      * $Al^{3+}$ - Aluminum
      * $Ag^+$ - Silver
      * $Zn^{2+}$ - Zinc
    * List of common monoatomic anions:
      * $H^-$ - Hydride
      * $F^-$ - Fluoride
      * $Cl^-$ - Chloride
      * $Br^-$ - Bromide
      * $I^-$ - Iodide
      * $O^{2-}$ - Oxide
      * $S^{2-}$ - Sulfide
      * $N^{3-}$ - Nitride
      * $p^{3-}$ - Phosphide
  * Ionic Binary Compounds (type II)
    * Many metals can form more than one type of cation and thus can form
    multiple ionic compounds with a signel anion. We must specify charge in
    these cases to prevent ambiguity.
    * Some older naming systems distinguished between cations like this with
    two different metals by putting -ic at the end of those with higher charge
    and -ous on the ones with lower charge. Ie $Fe^{3+}$ is the ferric ion and
    $Fe^{2+}$ is the ferrous ion.
    * The other system simply uses roman numerals to indicate the charge after
    the name of the element. For example $Fe^{3+}$ would be the iron(III) ion.
    The textbook uses this naming scheme.
    * The elements that need to be named like this usually aren't in groups 1A
    (alkali metals) or 2A (alkaline earth metals) because they only form 1+
    and 2+ cations respectively, but some transition metals do need this due
    to their very different electron configuration.
    * When naming Type II compounds, it is important to balance the charges to
    determine the cation charge (ie if just given a chemical formula without
    charge), and then insert a roman numeral after the element name.
    * Some common type II cation names (in Ion/Systematic - Roman Numeral
    - Alternate Name format):
      * $Fe^{3+}$ - Iron(III) - Ferric
      * $Fe^{2+}$ - Iron(II) - Ferrous
      * $Cu^{2+}$ - Copper(II) - Cupric
      * $Cu^{+}$ - Copper(I) - Cuprous
      * $Co^{3+}$ - Cobalt(III) - Cobaltic
      * $Co^{2+}$ - Cobalt(II) - Cobaltous
      * $Sn^{4+}$ - Tin(IV) - Stannic
      * $Sn^{2+}$ - Tin(II) - Stannous
      * $Pb^{4+}$ - Lead(IV) - Plumbic
      * $Pb^{2+}$ - Lead(II) - Plumbous
      * $Hg^{2+}$ - Mercury(II) - Mercuric
      * $Hg_2^{2+}$ - Mercury(I) - Mercurous
  * Ionic Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions
    * Polyatomic ions are assigned special names that must be memorized.
    * There are several polyatomic cations that just differ by the number
    of oxygen atoms. They are called oxyanions and the one with the smaller
    number of oxygen atoms ends in -ite and the one with more ends in -ate.
    Hypo- and per- are used as prefixes for species with even more. Hypo
    being on the lower end per being on the higher end.
    * Some common polyatomic ion names:
      * $NH_4^+$ - Ammonium
      * $NO_2^-$ - Nitrite
      * $NO_2^-$ - Nitrate
      * $SO_3^{2-}$ - Sulfite
      * $SO_4^{2-}$ - Sulfate
      * $HSO_4^{-}$ - Hydrogen sulfate (bisulfate commonly used too)
      * $OH^-$ - Hydroxide
      * $CN^-$ - Cyanide
      * $PO_4^{3-}$ - Phosphate
      * $HPO_4^{2-}$ - Hydrogen Phosphate
      * $H_2PO_4^-$ - Dihydrogen phosphate
      * $CO_3^{2-}$ - Carbonate
      * $HCO_3^-$ - Hydrogen carbonate
      * $C_2H_3O_2^-$ - Acetate
      * $MnO_4^-$ - Permanganate
      * $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$ - Dichromate
      * $CrO_4^{2-}$ - Chromate
      * $O_2^{2-}$ - Peroxide
      * $ClO^-$ - Hypochlorite
      * $ClO_2^-$ - Chlorite
      * $ClO_3^-$ - Chlorate
      * $ClO_4^-$ - Perchlorate
  * Covalent binary compounds
    * These compounds are formed between two nonmetals. They are named somewhat
    similarly to ionic compounds.
    * The following rules apply:
      * The first element is named first using the full element name
      * The second element is named as if it were an anion
      * Prefixes are used to denote the number of atoms present
        * mono - 1
        * di - 2
        * tri - 3
        * tetra - 4
        * penta - 5
        * hexa - 6
        * hepta - 7
        * octa - 8
      * The prefix mono is never used on the first element.
      * The final o or a of the prefix is usually dropped whenever an element
      starts with a vowel.
    * Some elements are usually referred to by their common names like water
    for $H_2O$ and ammonia for $NH_3$.
    * Some examples:
      * $N_2O$ - Dinitrogen monoxide
      * $NO$ - Nitrogen monoxide
      * $NO_2$ - Nitrogen Dioxide
      * $N_2O_3$ - Dinitrogen trioxide
      * $N_2O_4$ - Dinitrogen tetroxide
      * $N_2O_5$ - Dinitrogen pentoxide
  * Acids
    * An acid can be viewed as a molecule with one or more $H^+$ ions attached
    to an anion.
    * The rules for naming acids are dependent upon whether or not the acid
    contains oxygen.
      * If the acid does not contain oxygen it is named with the prefix hydro
      and the suffix -ic. Ie HCl -> Hydrochloric acid
      * If the acid contains oxygen the root name of the anion is used with a
      suffix of -ic or -ous. If the anion ends with -ate, the acid suffix is
      -ic and if the anion ends with -ite the acid name ends with -ous.
    * Some examples:
      * $HF$ - Hydrofluoric acid
      * $HCl$ - Hydrochloric acid
      * $HBr$ - Hydrobromic acid
      * $HI$ - Hydroiodic acid
      * $HCN$ - Hydrocyanic acid
      * $H_2S$ - Hydrosulfuric acid
      * $HNO_3$ - Nitric acid
      * $HNO_2$ - Nitrous acid
      * $H_2SO_4$ - Sulfuric acid
      * $H_2SO_3$ - Sulfurous acid
      * $H_3PO_4$ - Phosphoric acid
      * $HC_2H_3O_2$ - Acetic acid
  * Formulas from names
    * Deriving the chemical formula from a name is also pretty important.
    * Usually just involves a little bit of figuring some stuff out and
    making sure everything is balanced.
