# Prelecture 1 Notes 1/9/2023

* Appendices 1.6,2.1-2.2
  * Appendix 1.6 - Significant Figures
    * Rules that have been developed from statistical analyses of how error
    accumulates when performing operations.
    * Rules for counting significant figures
      * Nonzero digits always count as significant figures
      * Captive zeros/the zeros that are between other nonzero digits always
      count as significant figures
      * Trailing rights are zeros at the right end of the number. They only
      count as significant figures if there is a decimal place within the
      number.
      * Exact numbers are considered to have an infinite number of
      significant figures. For example, when converting inches to cm,
      the conversion ratio is exactly 1 inch to 2.54 cm, so we can
      consider the conversion ratio to have an infinite number of
      significant figures.
    * Apparently there is a journal article titled "Propogation of Significant
    Figures" that covers some of the edge cases here in more detail.
    * Rules for significant figures in math operations
      * For multiplication or division, the number of significant figures in
      the output is equal to the minimum of the number of significant figures
      of the inputs.
      * For addition or subtraction, the result has the same number of decimal
      places as the term with the least number of decimal places.
    * Rules for rounding
      * Always complete a series of calculations before figuring out where to
      round off.
      * Standard rounding rules apply.
* Skim of Chapter 1
  * Chemistry involves a lot of problem solving.
  * Lots of collaboration among people within the discipline as well as people
  outside of it to solve real world problems.
  * Industrial chemistry is a lot different than academic chemistry.
  * PVC is a great example of real world chemistry. Some of the additives that
  give it properties (like plasticizers that make it less brittle) are not
  even fully understood.
* Chapter 2.0-2.5
  * Boyle was the first one to perform truly quantitative experiments in
  Chemistry. He got rid of notions about the number of elements and proposed
  the definition of an element to solely include something that can't be broken
  down into more parts. Still wrong in quite a few cases.
  * Lavoisier came up with the law of conservation of mass by carefully weighing
  all of his reactants and products while performing reactions.
  * Proust, building off of the work of Lavoisier, came up with the law of
  definite proportions, supposing that each compound has a fixed ratio of
  fundamental elements.
  * Dalton, inspired by Proust, began to think about atoms. He came up
  with the law of multiple proportions which states that the ratios of
  elements can be reduced to small whole numbers. This still left a lot
  of room for improvement though since the formulas that described
  certain compounds could not be agreed upon.
  * Dalton prepared the first table of atomic masses. This was a good first
  step, but many of the values were wrong due the previously mentioned
  incorrect assumptions about the formulas of compounds.
  * Later work from Gay-Lussac and Avogadro fixed this. Experiments that
  eventually informed Avogadro's hypothesis (fixed number of moles even
  given different gasses assuming temperature and pressure are the same)
  allowed for the determination of the number of molecules present,
  allowed for the accurate determination of chemical formula.
  * This didn't actually get pushed into the filed until Cannizarro
  put Dalton's ideas and Avogadro's ideas together.
  * JJ Thompson was one of the first to really study electrons using
  cathode ray tubes. Measuring the deflection of an electrom beam in
  a magnetic field, Thompson was able to determine the charge to mass
  ratio of an electron.
  * He came up with the plum pudding model of the atom with electrons
  sitting within a sphere of positive charge.
  * Milkan, performing his own experiments and using data from Thompson
  was able to determine the mass of an electron.
  * Scientists around this time (such as Becquerel and Curie) discovered
  radioactivity.
  * Rutherford carried out an experiment to test the plum pudding model,
  hypothesizing that if it were accurate, alpha particles fired at a piece
  of foil would pass through/punch holes/ This turned out to not be accurate
  and while most of the particles passed through, a lot of them were
  deflected.
  * Rutherford came up with the idea of a nuclear atom with a dense
  center of positive charge (the nucleus) with electrons moving around it.
