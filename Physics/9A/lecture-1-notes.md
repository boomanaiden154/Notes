# Physics 9A Notes 1/9/22 - Intro Lecture

* Grade Structure
  * Lecture
  * Discussion
  * Lab
* Lab
  * Grde on deliverables
    * Lab report
    * Participation
    * Prelab
    * Other things up to the discretion of the lab TAs
  * Usually graded on a high pass/mid pass/low pass scale
    * High pass is +1 step (ie A to A+), mid pass is +0.5 step (whatever that
    means) and low pass has no change. These things were mentioned and I
    extrapolated so I wouldn't trust them to be right. No pass does imply
    failing the course though.
* Grade
  * Midterms (20% each)
  * Final (30%)
  * Homework (20%)
  * Lecture quizzes (5% top 10 scores are taken inteneded to be an easy 5%)
  * Discussion sections (5%, grading is up to the discussion TA)
* Homework sets due on Wednesday starting from next week
* Quizzes just about every lecture, exceptions will be noted ahead of time
* Discussion grades are upt ot the TA
* Collaboration is very good for homework
* Class is very much curved
  * About a 20% cap for As
  * About a 40% cap for Bs
  * About a 40% cap for Cs
  * B is the middle of the standard deviation most likely
* Textbook
  * UC Davis Libretexts 9A is the offical textbook
    * Lecturer seems to have a meh opinion of it
  * Helpful non-official textbooks reccomended by the lecturer:
    * University Physics
      * Authors: Sears, Zemansky, Young, Freedmann
      * Supposed to be very well written
  * Concepts of Physics Vol 1
    * Author: HC Verma
    * Problems are supposed to be really good and are supposed to be similar to
    what will be on the midterms/finals. Might be good for practice.
    * $20 on Amazon apparently.
* Class is supposed to balance between mathematical rigor and physical
intuition.
* Math concepts needed
  * Vectors
  * Differential and Integral Calculus
  * Differential Equations
  * Multivariable Calculus
* Selfcare
  * Sleep (7-8 hours)
  * Non-academic endeavors
  * Water
  * Therapy/Psychiatry
  * Lecturer doesn't like the use of "stupid", "dumb", or "lazy". Use will be
  corrected within class.
* Motion
  * Lecturer asks question of how to describe where someone else is setting.
  Response has a couple components
    * Right - Direction
    * 4 feet - magnitude
    * Reference is implicit
  * 1D motion
    * Direction implicit in the sign of the position in most cases.
    * $x(t)$ is used to denote position at time t. Denotes position as being time
    dependent.
    * $x(t)$ is usually assumed to be continuous and differentiable.
    * How fast the position is changing - velocity denoted $v(t)$
    $$v(t)=\frac{d}{dt}x(t)$$
    * Rate of change of velocity is acceleration
    $$a(t)=\frac{d}{dt}v(t)$$
    * Always answer "it depends" or "maybe" in lecture.
    * If we know $a(t)$, find $v(t)$:
    $$\int_{0}^{t}a(t)dt=v(t)-v(0)$$
    Fundamental theorem of Calculus
    * Number of needed initial conditions is equal to the degree of the
    differential equation.
    * $$a(t)=\frac{d^2}{dt^2}x(t)$$
    Two initial conditions are needed.
