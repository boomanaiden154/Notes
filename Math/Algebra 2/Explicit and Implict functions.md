#Implicit functions and Explicit functions
Implicit and explicit functions both have there own uses, but you should know how to classify both of them for later, so you can recognize an implicit function and use implicit differentiation vs explicit differentation. So, now lets look at explicit functions.
##Explicit functions
An explicit function is a function which can be written explicitly in terms of the the independent variable. The independent variable in our functions that we are going to analyze are either $f(x)$ or $y$. This means that the independent variable will be on one side of the equation all by itself and it equal the rest of the equation. For example, all linear functions of the form $y=mx+b$ are explicit. Most functions that you will encounter will be explicit.
##Implicit functions
Implicit functions are functions which cannot be written in terms of the independent variable. This means that you cannot algebraically manipulate the function to have the independent variable on one side of the equation. For example, the unit circle equation $x^2+y^2=1$, is an implicit function. 
##Why is this useful?
This is useful because once you get into studying higher level math such as Calculus, you will need to be able to recognize implicit functions because if you need to take the derivative of a function, if it is implicit the differentiation formula is quite a bit different. 
##Examples
1. $y=5x+3$ is an explicit function because it can be written explicitly in terms of the independent variable. Also, any equation of the form $y=mx+b$ is explicit.
2. $2x-3y=6$ is also an explicit function because it can be algebraically rearranged to become an equation of the form $y=mx+b$ which is explicit. 
3. $y = 5x^2+3x+5$ is an explicit function because it is written in terms of the independent variable $y$. This equation would also be explicit if it was written like this: $y-5x^2=3x+5$. It should also be noted that any equation of the form $ax^2 + bx +c$.
4. Any polynomial equation is explicit.
