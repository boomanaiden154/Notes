    "# Double Integration in Polar Coordinates\n",
    "While over the past three articles, we've seen that double integration over cartesian coordinates is a useful and powerful tool, sometimes these integrals can be difficult to evaluate in their cartesian form. Integrating in polar coordinates by converting a cartesian double integral to its polar form or simply expressing the problem in terms of polar coordinates. Typically, integrals are defined as sums of rectangles, but this makes less sense when looking at polar regions. Let's look at one:"
